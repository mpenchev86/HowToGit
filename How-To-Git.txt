RENAME REMOTE BRANCH:

You just have to create a new local branch with the desired name, push it to your remote, and then delete the old remote branch:

$ git branch new-branch-name origin/old-branch-name
$ git push origin --set-upstream new-branch-name
$ git push origin :old-branch-name
Then, to see the old branch name, each client of the repository would have to do:

$ git fetch origin
$ git remote prune origin
NOTE: If your old branch is your main branch, you should change your main branch settings. Otherwise, when you run  $ git push origin :old-branch-name, you'll get the error "deletion of the current branch prohibited".

RENAME LOCAL BRANCH:
git branch -m new-branch-name
